This repo contains the main drivers used in all of the projects (in a separate) directory, and some othher simple drivers are in the projects them selves.
Every project is built using Eclipse IDE and simulated by proteus (proteus schematics are included)
Main drivers are:

2) EEPROM
3) GPIO
4) I2C
5) ICU
6) KEYPAD
7) LCD
8) MOTOR
9) PWM
10) TIMER
11) UART
Projects are:
